Public Innovation's Business Plan

## About this Plan

Public Innovation is an open platform for co-creation. Our goal is to build a civic innovation and social entrepreneurship ecosystem in the Sacramento region. This plan is all about how we're going to do that.

In addition to being our first app, OpenOrg is much more than simply a business plan. OpenOrg represents our commitment to being an open, emergent organization. But this is just the beginning.

As our strategy evolves, this plan, too, will evolve. And this is your invitation to help evolve it.

Welcome to OpenOrg.
