# Implementation Strategy
###### From here to there.

## A. Business Plan Timeline			

As of October 2013, our plan is divided into two phases over five years. Details in this business plan focus on the first phase and cover two years, from January 2014 to December 2015. The goals in each phase are as follows:

## B. Strategic Goals

### 1. Position Public Innovation as an open platform for co-creation

First and foremost, Public Innovation must position itself as an open platform. This will allow us to forge a new kind of thinking in the region about organizational design. As an open organization, we will allow others to shape our direction and foster mutual trust among stakeholders, public officials, and the general public.

Platform thinking comes from the technology space, but technology is simply the manifestation of people and process. So, as an open organization, we believe it’s vitally important that we are open about the people with whom we engage and the processes by which we co-create solutions. Our platform, CivicExchange, will enable individuals and organizations to voluntarily join the ecosystem and decide for themselves whether they want their involvement public or private. Users will be able to create user accounts and login from my.publicinnovation.org where they will then be prompted to enter basic information that will allow us to connect them with other users with similar interests. Again, we do not expect to build a robust online platform, as our intent is to use our digital assets to structure in-person collaboration. But a digital platform is necessary to organize mass co-creation and provide us with data to prioritize and sequence our activities. 

### 2. Create the scaffolding to drive toward collective impact

Collective impact sounds great in theory, but it’s incredibly difficult to implement in reality. At the core of any collective impact initiative is the relationships between the individuals and organizations that comprise the network. And relationships are hard to maintain. Competition for funding and recognition can lead to bruised egos. It’s difficult to overcome that friction.

While Public Innovation won’t be capable of solving or preventing the conflicts that result from these fundamental facts of human nature, we can build the scaffolding to enable better communication and reduce the complexity associated with massive multi-sector collaborative efforts. 

### 3. Model a “culture first” philosophy to demonstrate our theory of change

Throughout the past 40 years, there has been an increasing emphasis on the role of public policy in driving change. We believe, however, that we are at the cusp of a revolution that is moving away from policy and toward a culture of trust. The architecture of open systems allows for real-time transparency to expose emergent approaches to service delivery, mitigating the need for overly prescriptive policies that inhibit creativity and flexibility in the pursuit of public goals. Today we are able to quickly determine whether or not a particular approach is working and pivot as necessary.

The public is not at a point, however, where it is willing to trust government to deliver services in an environment of ambiguity. We will begin to model how real-time openness can restore trust and create an authorizing environment where experimentation is not only permitted, but expected, as a tool for accelerating progress. Through the use of open data, we can objectively demonstrate the value of putting culture ahead of policy.

### 4. Build regional capacity for civic and social innovation projects

Fiscal prudence is a value that most business owners, nonprofit executives, and public officials hold in high regard. No one wants to throw their money away by funding unproven approaches. While this mindset is completely rational, it’s led to a best practices industry complex where off-the-shelf solutions are sought to solve problems for which a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient. Similarly, if everyone followed best practices, we would cease to evolve.

So Public Innovation will build the necessary capacity to launch in local civic and social innovation projects. We will marshal the resources from a large number of sources to diversify investment and reduce risk for any single organization. 

### 5. Incubate and test new ideas for impact

Much of the Sacramento region’s risk aversion could be mitigated with the creation of a space with the explicit purpose of incubating ideas. Along with incubation comes failure and failure is okay if it’s done in a way that’s smart, quick, and cheap. In the same way that this business plan is a prototype, we want to help public agencies, nonprofits, and social enterprises prototype their way to better outcomes.

Our approach to creating better civic experiences is rooted in the disciplines of user experience (UX) and interaction design. This means that we start with needs. All too often we’re inclined to start with a solution and this habit is exacerbated when the particular problem at hand is faced by a community of which we do not belong. Sacramento has no shortage of think tanks capable of making recommendations based on the analysis of data, but we do lack a willingness to experiment. In particular, we need to better understand the needs of those for whom we want to co-create solutions with -- not for. Borrowing from the toolkit of user experience designers, we want to get out in the field and perform usability testing with our potential users, much like the approach Smart Chicago Collaborative has taken with its Civic User Testing Group. Public Innovation will embrace this approach and provide it as a service.

### 6. Link our programs and projects to salient quality of life indicators

Although there is much detail in this plan, we need to get even more specific if we want to be confident that we are making a difference. This will require a robust system of measurement that links our programs and projects to the quality of life outcome areas in which we want to accelerate progress. As with everything we do, these metrics will be transparent and open for community feedback.

### 7. Produce a library of immersive digital content experiences

Our last strategy is designed to “close the loop” by telling the stories of both innovations that are already happening and those to which we are making an active contribution. There are numerous compelling stories that simply aren’t being told. We will expose the vibrant personalities of those changemakers working to make our region a better place and highlight their valuable work.
