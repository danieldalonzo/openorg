## B. Strategic Goals

### 1. Position Public Innovation as an open platform for co-creation

First and foremost, Public Innovation must position itself as an open platform. This will allow us to forge a new kind of thinking in the region about organizational design. As an open organization, we will allow others to shape our direction and foster mutual trust among stakeholders, public officials, and the general public.

Platform thinking comes from the technology space, but technology is simply the manifestation of people and process. So, as an open organization, we believe it’s vitally important that we are open about the people with whom we engage and the processes by which we co-create solutions. Our platform, CivicExchange, will enable individuals and organizations to voluntarily join the ecosystem and decide for themselves whether they want their involvement public or private. Users will be able to create user accounts and login from my.publicinnovation.org where they will then be prompted to enter basic information that will allow us to connect them with other users with similar interests. Again, we do not expect to build a robust online platform, as our intent is to use our digital assets to structure in-person collaboration. But a digital platform is necessary to organize mass co-creation and provide us with data to prioritize and sequence our activities. 

### 2. Create the scaffolding to drive toward collective impact

Collective impact sounds great in theory, but it’s incredibly difficult to implement in reality. At the core of any collective impact initiative is the relationships between the individuals and organizations that comprise the network. And relationships are hard to maintain. Competition for funding and recognition can lead to bruised egos. It’s difficult to overcome that friction.

While Public Innovation won’t be capable of solving or preventing the conflicts that result from these fundamental facts of human nature, we can build the scaffolding to enable better communication and reduce the complexity associated with massive multi-sector collaborative efforts. 

### 3. Model a “culture first” philosophy to demonstrate our theory of change

Throughout the past 40 years, there has been an increasing emphasis on the role of public policy in driving change. We believe, however, that we are at the cusp of a revolution that is moving away from policy and toward a culture of trust. The architecture of open systems allows for real-time transparency to expose emergent approaches to service delivery, mitigating the need for overly prescriptive policies that inhibit creativity and flexibility in the pursuit of public goals. Today we are able to quickly determine whether or not a particular approach is working and pivot as necessary.

The public is not at a point, however, where it is willing to trust government to deliver services in an environment of ambiguity. We will begin to model how real-time openness can restore trust and create an authorizing environment where experimentation is not only permitted, but expected, as a tool for accelerating progress. Through the use of open data, we can objectively demonstrate the value of putting culture ahead of policy.

### 4. Build regional capacity for civic and social innovation projects

Fiscal prudence is a value that most business owners, nonprofit executives, and public officials hold in high regard. No one wants to throw their money away by funding unproven approaches. While this mindset is completely rational, it’s led to a best practices industry complex where off-the-shelf solutions are sought to solve problems for which a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient. Similarly, if everyone followed best practices, we would cease to evolve.

So Public Innovation will build the necessary capacity to launch in local civic and social innovation projects. We will marshal the resources from a large number of sources to diversify investment and reduce risk for any single organization. 

### 5. Incubate and test new ideas for impact

Much of the Sacramento region’s risk aversion could be mitigated with the creation of a space with the explicit purpose of incubating ideas. Along with incubation comes failure and failure is okay if it’s done in a way that’s smart, quick, and cheap. In the same way that this business plan is a prototype, we want to help public agencies, nonprofits, and social enterprises prototype their way to better outcomes.

Our approach to creating better civic experiences is rooted in the disciplines of user experience (UX) and interaction design. This means that we start with needs. All too often we’re inclined to start with a solution and this habit is exacerbated when the particular problem at hand is faced by a community of which we do not belong. Sacramento has no shortage of think tanks capable of making recommendations based on the analysis of data, but we do lack a willingness to experiment. In particular, we need to better understand the needs of those for whom we want to co-create solutions with -- not for. Borrowing from the toolkit of user experience designers, we want to get out in the field and perform usability testing with our potential users, much like the approach Smart Chicago Collaborative has taken with its Civic User Testing Group. Public Innovation will embrace this approach and provide it as a service.

### 6. Link our programs and projects to salient quality of life indicators

Although there is much detail in this plan, we need to get even more specific if we want to be confident that we are making a difference. This will require a robust system of measurement that links our programs and projects to the quality of life outcome areas in which we want to accelerate progress. As with everything we do, these metrics will be transparent and open for community feedback.

### 7. Produce a library of immersive digital content experiences

Our last strategy is designed to “close the loop” by telling the stories of both innovations that are already happening and those to which we are making an active contribution. There are numerous compelling stories that simply aren’t being told. We will expose the vibrant personalities of those changemakers working to make our region a better place and highlight their valuable work.

## C. Tactical Goals

### 1. Team and Governance

__PHASE ONE GOAL:__ Formalize organizational structure, establish leadership roles, and hire core team.

#### a. Fiscal Sponsor

As soon as we see a signal that we'll be successful in raising initial seed funding, we will begin the process of searching for a peer organization with 501(c)(3) status who can temporarily act as our fiscal sponsor. The role of this sponsor organization is to accept tax-deductible donations until Public Innovation is able to receive 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. Our fiscal sponsor also will manage administrative functions such as payroll, benefits, and accounting. We will provide ten percent of our revenues to our sponsor until we the IRS grants us tax-exempt status and we are prepared to establish ourselves as an independent entity.

#### b. Board of Directors

As part of our initial fundraising efforts, Public Innovation will offer membership to our board of directors to individuals who are able to successfully connect us to funding sources. We also seek regional leaders with a demonstrated commitment to innovation and who are tolerant of risk and ambiguity. The board of directors will establish our governance structure and guide decision-making at a strategic level. In addition, our board will hold executive staff accountable for the outcome of our work. We expect the number of members to remain relatively small and that the board will meet on a quarterly basis.

#### c. Advisors

Public Innovation already has a stellar group of advisors guiding our effort. These indiduals have a non-fiduciary role and are experts in their fields. They will be listed here upon their consent:

*Organizational affiliation listed for identifcation purposes only.*

#### d. Organizational Structure

As a startup, our organizational structure is small, agile, and emergent. We are led by a two-person team. Combined with the board we hope to eventually recruit, organizational roles and responsibilities are as follows:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
	       	<th>Role</th>
	        <th>Responsibilities</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        	<td><strong>Board of Directors</strong><br />
				<p><em>Membership to be determined</em></p>
            <td>
            	<ul>
            		<li>Approves and monitors business plan</li>
					<li>Holds Executive Director accountable for performance</li>
					<li>Monitors finances</li>
					<li>Guides strategic direction</li>
					<li>Identifies new opportunities</li>
				<ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
        	<td><strong>Founder and Executive Director</strong><br />
				<p><em>Ash Roughani</em></p></td>
            <td>
            	<ul>
            		<li>Leads business plan implementation</li>
					<li>Oversees and manages all projects</li>
					<li>Monitors organizational and program performance</li>
					<li>Directs user experience and customer development</li>
					<li>Hires staff</li>
				<ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
        	<td><strong>Co-founder and Lead Technologist</strong><br />
				<p><em>Thomas Hopkins</em></p></td>
            <td>
            	<ul>
            		<li>Leads civic technology projects</li>
					<li>Guides technical decision-making</li>
					<li>Develops design standards</li>
				<ul>
			</td>
		</tr>       
    </tbody>
</table>

#### e. Staffing Plan

Our two-person founding team has bootstrapped Public Innovation to date. Our Year One budget includes funding for a third TBD position and would likely have responsibilities over external relations, business development, and marketing. In Year Three, we plan to hire a fourth position and in all years would have sufficient funds for intern stipends, limited-term contract work, and professional services.
