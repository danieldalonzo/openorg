# Social Impact Model
###### Our theory of change

## A. Overview of Organization

Public Innovation is an incubator for civic and social innovations in the Sacramento region. Our core competency is bringing people together to solve public problems and improve the citizen experience. We believe that breakthrough solutions require the engagement of individuals and organizations from diverse backgrounds and sectors. By leveraging the creativity and collective capacity of all people, we’re able to cross-pollinate ideas that lead to new ways of accelerating quality of life improvements. In the end, however, the network itself is the true innovation.

As a small nonprofit, our goal is not to solve every problem, but to instead develop a set of tools that enable and empower collaboration at a community and regional level. We know that many organizations currently assume this role. However, what’s missing is a welcoming entry point for new players. We will act as that entry point by providing resources and support for anyone who has a good idea and the drive to turn that idea into reality. In other words, we will be disrupting the status quo by enabling new market and value network to flourish for civic and social innovations.

### 1. Innovation defined

What do we mean by innovation?
Professor Andrew Hargadon, Director of the UC Davis Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, innovation is “the generation, development, and deployment of new, nonobvious, and valuable ideas.” He delineates

### 1. Social Problem Definition

Bureaucracy dehumanizes individuals and inhibits the inherent talent within an organization. This results in untapped value creation opportunities and arbitrarily constrains the potential collective capacity to generate new solutions to problems. Government is the poster child for bureaucracy and the Sacramento region is home to one of the largest subnational governments in the world.

With a third of our workforce employed by government, there are significant implications that bureaucracy imposes on the culture of our region. We cannot isolate the impact that cumbersome rules, steep hierarchies, and overspecialization have on the mental models through which we see the world -- whether we work in government or are customers of government. These mental models influence our perceptions of what’s possible and, therefore, affect our collective behavior. These impacts can manifest themselves in the form of would-be entrepreneurs wallowing in risk averse mindset, underserved youth lacking the confidence to challenge themselves academically, or artists being undervalued for the contributions they make building a vibrant creative community.

In short, Sacramento’s legacy consists of a culture of mediocrity that is, in large part, driven by the dominance of a government-industrial complex. This is no surprise, as many of the features of government are designed to maintain stability and, therefore, the status quo. While many organizations have attempted to modernize our civic operating systems, few if any efforts to address the culture itself have been attempted.

### 2. Mission

The mission of Public Innovation is to build the basic scaffolding of a civic innovation and social entrepreneurship ecosystem. This ecosystem will comprise a space where creative approaches to tackling public issues are initiated, developed, and supported. Using the concept of an open platform, we will empower change agents who want to improve their organizations and communities by connecting them with each other and by providing them with the tools to accelerate regional progress. 

### 3. Indicators

#### a. Social & Economic Impact

To measure our social and economic impact, we will begin by with the following indicators:
* Quality of life outcomes within areas where we pursue projects
* Cost savings delivered to public agencies and nonprofit organizations

#### b. Organizational & Program Performance

To measure our organizational and program performance, we will begin by with the following indicators:
* Number of engaged users
* Number of organizational partners per project
* Number of total projects initiated

### 4. Vision of Success

We envision a day when the Sacramento region is viewed by outsiders as the Silicon Valley of civic and social innovation. We believe that the wicked problems public agencies and nonprofits are tasked with tackling are opportunities to generate disruptive solutions through creative ideation, rapid prototyping, and human centered design. Similarly, engaged citizens will create an authorizing environment where they trust their public officials to take safe risks. We’ll celebrate failures quickly And by leveraging our position as the state’s capital, citizens will be able to find the information they need regardless of the level of government responsible. 

Our vision is for a radically different civic experience than exists today and one in which anyone with a good idea to improve our shared civic infrastructure will have the tools at their disposal to co-create the changes they want to see in their organizations and communities. Together we will disrupt bureaucracy.

## C. Description of Operating Model

### 1. Open Platform

Public Innovation will operate as an open platform for co-creation and co-production of civic and social innovations. Although this will require us to have a significant level of transparency around our operations, that is merely a consequence and not the goal of being an open organization. Our primary purpose for pursuing openness is to enable others to build upon our civic infrastructure.

Because so much of the work of innovation requires a networked approach, we must create the spaces in which individuals and organizations can not only connect with each other, but also have a keen understanding of who’s doing what. This helps to avoid duplication of effort and ensures added value is consistently being contributed across the larger ecosystem.

### 2. Civic and Social Innovation Ecosystem

Innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems characterize the interactions of individual elements that work synergistically to co-generate creative solutions and exploit latent market opportunities. In a similar vein, Brad Feld describes the four necessary ingredients for startup communities to thrive:

1. Two types of people: __leaders__ (entrepreneurs) and __feeders__ (people who support startups, such as government agencies, funders, service providers). While the "feeders" are the very fabric of the community, the entrepreneurs must be in the lead. 
2. A __long-term view__ and __commitment__ to building this community.
3. A __philosophy of inclusiveness__ that welcomes everyone with an interest, not just entrepreneurs.
4. __Substantive activities__ that engage the entire community to help startups move forward.

Here we identify some of the key components that will comprise the civic and social innovation ecosystem we seek to build.

#### a. People

Human capital is our region’s most important asset and engaged residents form the lifeblood of our innovation ecosystem. We are capitalizing on the desire of people to improve their communities using new tools and new ways of collaborating. But we’re not talking about your average homogenous group. We need civil servants interacting with artists, marketers collaborating with educators, and technologists helping nonprofit leaders. Much of Sacramento’s strength lies in its diversity. And when people from different backgrounds share their ideas, we get even better ideas.

#### b. Process
 
As much as we do think nor work linearly, Public Innovation’s value processes reflect a six-step value chain, along which projects are initiated and solutions are deployed. Each component segments engagement among a diverse set of organizational partners and adds public value at each stage. A networked approach to the innovation process maximizes throughput and allows us to scale our impact across the Capital Region with replicable projects.
					
1. __DISCOVERY:__ *Identifying Unmet Needs and Opportunities* 
Either an organization approaches us with a problem or citizens identify an opportunity to improve their communities through our our platform, CivicExchange. Although projects do not need to be initiated through this entry point, projects sought by proactive individuals and organizations will enjoy greater potential for impact.				

2. __IDEATION:__ *Forcing Serendipitous Collisions to Generate New Ideas* 
At CivicMeet Sacramento -- a monthly meetup for civic innovators from diverse backgrounds (including business, nonprofits, education, technology, and government), we co-design solutions to public problems. The more constraints, the more creative the ideas. This process also builds a community of citizens to support the successful adoption of the solutions they helped generate.				
3. __CO-PRODUCTION:__ *Supporting the Development of Civic Innovations* 
At Public Innovation Labs -- a civic innovation incubator -- we design, build, and test improvements to the citizen experience and back-office process innovations for public agencies and social enterprises. We also provide resources and support to social entrepreneurs who want to voluntarily collaborate on civic projects.				

4. __INTRAPRENEURSHIP:__ *Giving Public Servants and Nonprofit Leaders the Tools to Evangelize Change* 
To prepare civic leaders and public administrators for emerging innovations, our Civic Entrepreneurship Network will support knowledge sharing and change management within government and social impact organizations. This will result in user generated content, best practices, and panel discussions among change agents who want to be catalysts for improving their organizations. We also seek to provide services and education to improve the culture within organizations throughout the region.		

5. __DEPLOYMENT:__ *Deploying Solutions through Civic and Social Entrepreneurship* 
Once refined, solutions are deployed by Innovation Delivery Teams -- strategic partnerships among public agencies, nonprofits, and businesses. Crowdfunding and social impact bonds can help address resource constraints to sustain their implementation. These teams will support the diffusion of civic innovations and their composition will vary on a project-by-project basis.	

6. __STORYTELLING:__ *Measuring Progress and Celebrating Success* 
Public Innovation is committed to nurturing development of the larger ecosystem through multichannel marketing and communications campaigns that highlight and reward creative problem solving. In addition to tracking and maintaining quality of life indicators, we produce compelling video stories to articulate the value proposition of civic entrepreneurship.

Although this is our preferred process for project execution and reflects our theory of change, we will offer flexibility to clients who approach us with specific needs that do not require a comprehensive approach. Similarly, we expect our process to evolve based upon our analysis of key performance indicators. Lastly, while the process appears linear, it is often synchronous and iterative.

#### c. Resources

Resources enable capacity. While large-scale collaboration can afford significant capacity for a region, such efforts may lead to greater friction as the network grows. With that in mind, our intent is to provide the necessary resources that will reduce friction and activate the network. Specifically, our platform will perform this function.

Beyond providing capacity to organizations, however, we also need to empower the human potential of impact-driven individuals. Through our outreach, we will discover entrepreneurial-minded changemakers and provide them with the space, mentorship, education, network, and risk capital they need to develop and test their ideas. Those who are able to successfully validate their business models, will be given additional support to accelerate their progress and take their ideas to market.

#### d. Organizations

The Sacramento region has many anchor institutions, including public agencies, universities, chambers of commerce, foundations, nonprofits, incubators, and backbone organizations. Each organization already plays a critical role in our communities. However, Public Innovation will ask the organizations to formally partner with us in building a regional civic and social innovation ecosystem. In other words, all the pieces are in place, but we will advance progress by connecting existing efforts in new ways and encouraging greater experimentation to drive impact.

#### e. Technology

While we are not technological solutionists, we believe that technology has a significant role to play in connecting the ecosystem and lowering the barriers to collaboration. In the past, technology was viewed as a tool for engineers. Today, however, the most successful technologies are platforms that are simple, beautiful, easy-to-use, and solve real problems. Treated as a discipline of art and humanities, rather than electrical engineering, form always follows function. Our platform will simplify our users’ interaction within the civic and social innovation ecosystem. People need to quickly be able to find answers to their questions, contribute to the platform, and, ultimately, connect and engage with each other. Following the 80/20 rule, our platform will only be 20 percent of the solution while people and process are the other 80 percent.

## D. Description of Social Impact Strategies

Our basic strategy for driving social impact and accelerating quality of life improvements relies on recruiting, empowering, and connecting change agents. It is premised on the following:
Recruting change agents

### 1. Creating an open platform for co-creation

Although the term platform generally refers to a type of technology, Public Innovation -- the organization -- is itself an open platform. While we intend to build a specific technology platform, CivicExchange, to allow for easier engagement, our social impact will be derived from a human capital multiplier effect that is the result of diverse people coming together to co-create change in-person. And by open, we mean anyone with the passion to make a positive dent will be able to roll up their sleeves and join.

### 2. Collective impact

Cross-sector collaboration also will be critical to driving impact. This will require the engagement of individuals and organization from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. More importantly, however, it means a new paradigm in shared accountability. No longer is it acceptable for organizations and individuals to compete over who receives credit for success, much less over fixed slices of a pie. Everyone has a role to play and we need to acknowledge our interdependence and strive toward shared value.

### 3. Culture first

Public Innovation made a concerted effort to focus on the implementation of public policy rather than on its development. That means we’re largely policy-agnostic and benefit from staying out of the political fray. Because creativity loves constraints and we’re confident in our organizational agility, we can adapt our approach to any policy environment. Similarly, much of our work will be filling in gaps that policy cannot fill. For example, policy is a good tool for setting priorities and creating incentives, but it cannot force an individual to want to change their behavior.

By focusing on people and process, we believe that culture can change policy. And we flatly reject the idea that policy can change culture. Culture is an artifact of collective human behavior and we need to poke at the factors that motivate behavior rather than attempting force behavior change through policy.

Our “culture first” approach will tackle head-on distrust toward our public institutions. We intend to lead by example and reinforce a cycle of trust that will enable greater experimentation and risk-taking in the civic space.

### 4. Capacity building

We’re not just providing capacity for collaboration but, more importantly, capacity for innovation. The Sacramento region does not have a shortage of smart, creative people with good ideas. Instead, we lack the capacity to turn those ideas into great ideas and great ideas into reality.

### 5. Incubation

As a civic incubator, we want to help innovators develop, test, and refine their ideas. We want to serve both public agencies and social entrepreneurs. Public agencies need a safe space where they can take risks, and fail early and often. This can be done without great expense to taxpayers and presumably has significant potential to improve outcomes and reduce costs in the long-run. In other words, we need to celebrate failure and change our perspectives if we want to generate truly breakthrough solutions. Our hypothesis is that, over time, the public will gradually begin to trust their government more than they do today.

We also want to incubate new social enterprises and develop the next generation of change agents. In the past, the only way someone could make a difference outside of government was to start a nonprofit. Today there are a variety of alternative models for social impact including for-profit and hybrid organizations. 

### 6. Measuring success

Today’s ubiquity of open data means that it’s much easier to measure quality of life and our impact on its trajectory. Moreover, it gives us the opportunity to hold ourselves accountable for those outcomes which we’ve committed to achieving. Change is hard and it’s even more difficult to link an organization’s output to quality of life outcomes, particularly when macroeconomic and other societal factors . But there is intrinsic value in simply placing an organization’s outputs alongside the indicators it is working to improve, whether in education, health, or public safety. This juxtaposition can help members of the public better understand how change happens and, more importantly, inspire a conversation about what to do when we collectively fall off-track.

### 7. Storytelling

One of the most surprising findings in our work to date, is how much progress already is happening on the ground but of which there is little awareness. Today’s new media environment enables anyone with a camera phone to start their own TV station on YouTube. While that may be an overstatement, the cost of high-quality digital video production has dramatically fallen in recent years with the advent of DSLR cameras and other affordable tools for independent filmmakers. Similarly, the opportunities to curate user-generated content are virtually infinite. We are committed to telling the stories of innovators and their projects to raise awareness of and appreciation for the complex ecosystem that’s emerging.
