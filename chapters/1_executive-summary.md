#### [<< Forward](http://open.publicinnovation.org/chapters/forward/) | [Ch. 2: Need and Opportunity >>](http://open.publicinnovation.org/chapters/need-and-opportunity/)

Founded in 2012, Public Innovation is an early stage place-based, impact-focused organization committed to building a civic innovation and social entrepreneurship ecosystem in the Sacramento region. Our mission is to accelerate measurable quality of life improvements by developing, testing, and scaling new forms of creative problem solving.

Our team has studied the best models from across the country and placed them within a single entity to drive civic and social impact in an integrated way. Our solutions are generating *with* people, not *for* people, and we believe in cultivating and leveraging latent human capital among public servants, social impact leaders, and engaged citizens.

## Operating Model

As an open organization, we are *digital by default* and operate as a platform. This civic infrastructure will enable the networked approach needed to realize collective impact that transcends what any single individual or organization or organization could accomplish on their own.

In general, we employ the following process to the projects we pursue:

1. __DISCOVERY:__ Identifying unmet needs and opportunities.				
2. __IDEATION:__ Forcing serendipitous collisions to generate new ideas.
3. __CO-PRODUCTION:__ Supporting the co-development of civic and social innovations.
4. __INTRAPRENEURSHIP:__ Giving public servants and social impact leaders the tools to evangelize change. 
5. __DEPLOYMENT:__ Deploying solutions through civic and social entrepreneurship.
6. __STORYTELLING:__ Measuring progress and celebrating success.

## Strategy

We believe culture must come before policy, so we have a "culture first" philosophy. Rather than forcing behavior changes by mandate, we believe it's necessary to create the conditions in which people are motivated to change their behavior.

Innovation is not a methodology, but a mindset. To incubate the ideas that will have exponential impact, we must allow for and embrace failure. Public Innovation will provide that space where failure can happen quickly and without great expense. We will push for iteration upon iteration until success toward a given problem is achieved. 

## Timeline

Public Innovation's phased approach includes the following goals:

## Sustainability
