        <p class="lead">
          Dear Reader:
        </p>

        <p>
          I am all-too-often asked, "Why don’t you live in San Francisco?" The short answer is that I love this town. In fact, I love this region. But the question is poignant for myriad reasons. First, it assumes that Sacramento is not a place where creativity and innovation can thrive. Second, I’ve witnessed first-hand a churn of talent that migrates to the Bay Area in pursuit of better opportunities than could be had right here.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I launched Public Innovation last year, it was with an explicit and deliberate motivation to disrupt the status quo in Sacramento. And while the idea of building a civic innovation and social entrepreneurship ecosystem has been met with positive reception among hundreds of residents, there is much work to be done to bring our institutional leaders on board - whether they’re in business, academia, nonprofits, technology, or government.
        </p>

        <p>
          This, I would submit to you, is Sacramento’s greatest challenge: Does the next generation of potential leaders believe that risk-taking and entrepreneurship will be commensurately rewarded? Or, will who you know continue to trump what you know and what you’re capable of?
        </p>

        <p>
          Which brings us to the context of our public sector. Now, let’s just put it out there: I’m the guy that tried to start the California Moderate Party and miserably failed. What might seemingly be a reckless and foolish effort by some, is also seen as a heroic and much-needed antidote to the political dysfunction for which we, ourselves, are responsible. Rest assured, I’m over it.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, what remains to this day is a relentless and unquenching desire to fundamentally blur the distinction between citizens and their government. I have simply made a pivot from focusing on our political culture to reinvigorating a vibrant civic culture. Public Innovation is a platform for co-creation. Anyone with a good idea for improving our civic infrastructure and a willingness to roll up their sleeves to bring about change will find a home here.
        </p>

        <p>
          In short, we’re an incubator for civic projects. And our strength lies in the diversity of human capital we’re able to attract, resulting in the cross-pollination of ideas to improve our neighborhoods, communities, and our region. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The ensuing business plan is the result of a year of experimentation. It is not a plan based on untested assumptions. Rather, we are putting forth a business model that has been validated in almost every detail. That does not mean, however, that our strategy will not continue to evolve. As we’re able to collect and analyze data from our work, we will continuously improve.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan calls for $250,000 in initial seed funding. By our fifth year of operation, we we’ll be self-sustaining with 85 percent of total revenues comprising earned income.  In other words, we simply need a runway to get off the ground and once airborne, we can take it from there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sacramento not only has the opportunity, but the responsibility, to do better. And we hope agree that this is a plan to help get us there. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely,
          <br>
